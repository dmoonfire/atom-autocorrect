# AutoCorrect for Atom

This package provides a framework (but not actual corrections) for implementing real-time, inline corrections while typing. It is not intended to be used for complex substitutions or multiple options (use snippets for those) but for more automatic changes of common typos such as "teh" or "DOuble LEetters."

## Additional Packages

The following are additional packages that can be installed that will provide actual corrections:

* [AutoCorrect for Atom - English](https://github.com/dmoonfire/atom-autocorrect-en): Fixes common English typos while typing.
